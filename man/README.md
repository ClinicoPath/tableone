.Rd files
======

* These .Rd files were automatically created by the Roxygen2 package.

* The documents are stored in-source in the .R files in the R directory.

* The document() function in the devtools package compiles .Rd files from corresponding .R files.

* If there are .Rd files to start with, which I had, the Rd2roxygen package convert them and append them to the corresponding source files.
